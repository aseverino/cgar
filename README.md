**CGAR** (Computational Geometry Algorithms for Rust) is an early-stage project
aimed at becoming a **functional equivalent to [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/)** in Rust.  

The goal is to provide robust and efficient algorithms for computational geometry,
meshes, and geometric predicates‚Äîfully in safe Rust.

## üöß Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **This library is experimental.**  
There is not yet a stable or usable release. APIs may change at any time.

That said, the project already includes a solid foundation for building
geometry-heavy applications and welcomes early adopters and contributors.

## ‚ú® Features (so far)

- **Scalar types**
  - 64-bit floats (`f64`)
  - Exact rationals (`rug::Rational`)
  - Lazy-exact scalars (approximate until exact evaluation is required)

- **Algorithms**
  - Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CDT)
  - Mesh corefinement
  - Boolean operations: difference, union, intersection
  - Common predicates (e.g. point-in-mesh, point-on-border, plane side tests, etc)
  - AABB trees and spatial search structures
  - Topologically consistent mesh opperations (e.g.: edge/face splitting, edge collapse)

## üîÆ Roadmap

Planned areas of development include:

- Robust 2D/3D polygon mesh operations
- Isotropic remeshing
- Mesh simplification
- Poisson reconstruction
- Alpha wrapping
- More exact geometric predicates
- Performance improvements (parallelization, SIMD, etc.)
